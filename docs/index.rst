PocketCoffea
=========================

Introduction
------------

PocketCoffea is a slim analysis framework based on Coffea for CMS NanoAOD events.

The goal of the framework is to define an HEP analysis in a declarative way where possible (with a well defined
configuration file), and with python code where customization is needed (by defining new coffea processors).
